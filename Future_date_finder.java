/*  (Find future dates) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer for todayâ€™s day of the
week (Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, ..., and Saturday is 6). Also prompt the user to enter the number of
days after today for a future day and display the future day of the week. Here is a sample run:
Enter today's day: 1
Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 3
Today is Monday and the future day is Thursday
