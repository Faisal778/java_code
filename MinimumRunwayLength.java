/*   (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can
compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the following
formula:

length =
v
2
2a

Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration a in
meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway length. Here is a sample run:
Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
